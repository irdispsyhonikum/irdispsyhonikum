- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jurijs
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in esp32, arduino, cpp, c, python, RADXA and electronics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cpp, c, python
- ðŸ“« You can reach me here or on yurgen@mkelectronics.co.uk
- All you can find here, you can use if you will find in helpfull
- All I copyed from other sources is just to change, modify and use in learning purposes and original sources will be linked.
- I become a big fan of RADXA, as they are they provide more interesting boards and lots of space to maneuver.
